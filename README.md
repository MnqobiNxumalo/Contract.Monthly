I made many changes actually I changed the whole, judging from marks implementing a prototype using MVC was quite tough, so I made changes and did the project and used Web forms. 

I had to implement some additional page or class called login form, allowing users or lecturers to sign in when entering the Application. 

My prototype had links to connect or click something to enter I changed and made a button. 

Many implementations were taken using videos the lecturer recommended to the task.
